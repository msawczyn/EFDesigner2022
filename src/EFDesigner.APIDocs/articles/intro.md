# Entity Framework Designer T4 API

This document describes the subset of the API you can use to modify the T4 templates for code generation.

While the T4 templates supplied generate only C# code, the API help here shows both C# and VB.NET. 
For those interested in such things, this documentation is generated by DocFX.

## Getting Started

If you somehow got here by direct link, and need details on how to use the designer, please head over 
to the root of this documentation site to get more information. There's info there on how to get to the 
T4 templates installed by the extension, as well as a nice writeup on how to modify/extend the code 
generation the T4s provide.

### This documentation is a work in progress.

There is a ton of topics that aren't yet documented. If you need to know about something that's not 
spelled out yet, please post an issue on Github. The API docs will get better over time.
