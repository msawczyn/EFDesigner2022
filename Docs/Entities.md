# Persistent Entities

Modeling your persistent entities (classes) is the same experience as most any other modeling tool -- you drag the class onto the design surface from the toolbox, name it, and start adding properties. You won't model operations (methods), though, since our focus is on creating code for Entity Framework. 
If you want to add operations, you'll do that in partial classes.

## Adding an Entity

With the designer open, find the Entity tool in your toolbox. Click and hold down the left button, then drag it to the design surface.

<img src="images/Entity.jpg">

You should see a new class appear on the design surface:

<table><tr><td>
<img align="right"  src="images/Class.jpg">
</td></tr></table>

You can change the width of the entity on the designer to make things more readable. Height is automatic and can't
be changed manually - it will be as tall as needed to show all the properties.
But the entity may be collapsed down to its name bar by clicking the chevron at the top right of its display. When
collapsed, it may be expanded back to its original size by clicking the chevron again.

You can collapse and expand the `Properties` and `Associations` compartments by clicking the small `+` (or `-`) icon to the
left of their gray title bars.

A quick note about the `Associations` compartments. You'll note that they're divided into `Association Sources` and 
`Association Targets`. This really isn't a big distinction ... it has to do with how you started drawing the association and is
an artifact of the Microsoft Modeling SDK. One day (hopefully) they'll be combined into just `Associations`, but that will take
a refactoring of the inner structure of the designer and is a Big Deal. There's [more about Associations](Associations) later.

## Removing an Entity

To remove an entity, simply select it (from either the design surface or the model explorer) and hit the Delete key. 
It will be removed from the model completely without confirmation, as will its associations with other classes. 
If you do this by accident, you can undo it (Ctrl-Z or Edit/Undo from the menu).

If that entity is the superclass (base class) for other entities, you'll be asked if you want to push its
attributes and associations down to those other entities prior to its removal.

## Entity Properties

Selecting the entity from either the design surface or the model explorer allows you to edit its various properties:

If true, Properties for this class will be created as AutoProperties with just bare getters and setters. Otherwise, they'll have a backing field and code in the getters and setters to move the `value` parameters. In this case, you'll also have partial methods available to modify the results. </td></tr>

## Context Menu

Right-clicking on an entity displays a Visual Studio context menu with some new choices pertinent to that entity.

<table style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><tr><td>

<tr><td valign="top"> Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete                 </td><td valign="top">You can cut or copy, then paste, classes and enums. The pasted elements will be adjusted so that they don't violate any rules (such as two elements not having the same name), but otherwise the properties will stay the same. If no classes or enums are selected in the designer, the cut and copy options will be disabled. If no classes or enums are in the clipboard, the paste option will be disabled.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"> Hide Selected Elements                   </td><td valign="top">Hides the currently selected elements on the diagram. Any lines to or from those elements will be hidden as well. This does not remove the entity from the model, only makes it invisible in the diagram.

### INotifyPropertyChanged

You can optionally implement the standard `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface, especially useful for data binding in WinForms applications. By changing that property to `True` (by
default it's `False`), the standard T4 templates will generate code you can customize by implementing a partial method.

The shape on the diagram will change to have a dashed blue border, helping you immediately see which classes will generate 
change notification code. Since `INotifyPropertyChanged` requires a bit of logic, the properties of that class won't be 
autoproperties. Each property will be set to `AutoProperty = False` when `Implement INotifyPropertyChanged` is set 
to `True`; if you set `AutoProperty` to `True` while indicating that you want `INotifyPropertyChanged` code, you'll 
get a warning on model validation indicating that said property won't participate in change notification since it's an 
autoproperty. 


The generated code for a property will look like the following:

``` csharp
   /// <summary>
   /// Backing field for Foo
   /// </summary>
   protected string _Foo;
   /// <summary>
   /// When provided in a partial class, allows value of _Foo to be changed before setting.
   /// </summary>
   partial void SetFoo(string oldValue, ref string newValue);
   /// <summary>
   /// When provided in a partial class, allows value of _Foo to be changed before returning.
   /// </summary>
   partial void GetFoo(ref string result);

   public string Foo
   {
      get
      {
         string value = _Foo;
         GetFoo(ref value);
         return (_Foo = value);
      }
      set
      {
         string oldValue = _Foo;
         SetFoo(oldValue, ref value);
         if (oldValue != value)
         {
            _Foo = value;
            OnPropertyChanged();
         }
      }
   }

   public virtual event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

   protected virtual void OnPropertyChanged([CallerMemberName] string propertyName = null)
   {
      PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
   }
```

Note that this interface doesn't give you sufficient detail to know *how* a property changed, only *which* 
property changed; Microsoft never intended it to. Its initial purpose was to support data binding, so it's an
important part of .NET, but you need more info to handle property change notifications outside of a data binding
context. You have that in the code that's generated when you set `AutoProperty = False` in the model for an entity's
property.

Any generated property with a backing field gives you the chance to do work (log, massage the return value, etc.)
in their `get` and `set` methods by implementing the corresponding `GetXXX` and `SetXXX` partial functions. In those 
partials, you have access to the old and new values (for the `SetXXX` method) and can implement whatever logging, etc. 
you need. Therefore, when tracking changes, the generated `OnPropertyChanged` method will be used when the .NET Framework 
finds it appropriate but *your* work should go in the `SetXXX` partial method.
