# Properties

Properties can be added to entities, and will become class properties backed with database columns
upon code generation. They're generated with reasonable defaults, but can be easily modified to
suit your use cases.

## Adding a Property

<img align="right" src="images/PropertyProperties.jpg" hspace="10">

There are a few ways to add a property to an entity:

- Right click the _Properties_ category heading right below the name of the entity on the designer and choose _Add new Property_ .
- Right click the name of the entity on the designer and select _Add_, then _Property_ from its context menu.
- With the _Properties_ category heading selected on the designer, hit the _Insert_ key
- With any property selected in the entity on the designer, hit _Enter_.
- Right click the entity in the Model Explorer and select _Add New Property_.

A new property will be added to the entity and you'll have the opportunity to change its name from the default generated name. An advanced feature
of the designer also gives you the opportunity to change its type, whether or not it's an identity field, and whether or not its value is required to be
other than the type's default value at runtime (i.e., a _required_ property). See more about this below.

## Removing a Property

To remove a property, simply select it (on the designer or the Model Explorer) and hit the Delete key. It will be removed from the model completely without confirmation.

## Property Properties

Selecting a property gives you access to **its** properties in the Property window. Those are:

## Creating a multi-property index

There isn't any direct support in the designer for adding an index that spans more than one property, but that
doesn't mean it can't be done.

Just to be clear, we're not talking about identity properties here. For identity, setting the `Is Identity` flag for a property will
cause it to be used as part of the entity's identity, and that's for one property or more than one. This discussion is about
plain old indices. With the designer, you can have any property be indexed (by setting its `Indexed` flag to true), but
that creates an index for that property only; if you want to create one index for a _set_ of properties, you'll have to go beyond
the designer.

To do that, implement the `OnModelCreatedImpl` method in your context's partial class. There, you can add a method to 
create your index on however many properties you need. Something like

```
void OnModelCreatedImpl(System.Data.Entity.DbModelBuilder modelBuilder) {
   modelBuilder.Entity<Item>().HasIndex((Item b) => new { b.column1, b.column2, b.column3 });
}
```

## Context Menu

Right-clicking on a property displays a Visual Studio context menu with some new choices pertinent to that property.

If the pertinent element type isn't present in the designer, that option will be disabled.<br/>

## Adding Properties via Code (custom property syntax)

You can quickly add a group of properties as text, a great time saver for those cases where you have existing classes that you want to make
persistent and add to the model.

The designer exposes a custom property syntax that allows you to specify a property's:

- Setter visibility
- Name
- Type
- Required status
- Minimum length (if it's a string)
- Maximum length (if it's a string)
- Initial value
- Whether it's the identity property for its entity

All of these are optional except for *Name*. Some details:

<table>
<tr><td><b>Element</b></td><td><b>Default</b></td><td><b>Notes</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Required</td></tr>
<tr><td>Type</td><td>"string"</td><td>Can be CLR type or built-in type (e.g., Int32 or int)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Required</td><td>false</td><td>Indicated by the '?' symbol appended to the Type</td></tr>
<tr><td>Minimum Length</td><td>0</td><td>Indicated by a decimal number in brackets. If present, must be followed by hyphen <span style="display: inline-block;">('-')</span> and the maximum length. A zero (0) means no minimum length.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Maximum Length</td><td>0</td><td>Indicated by a decimal number in brackets. A zero (0) means no maximum length.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Initial Value</td><td></td><td>Indicated by an equal sign ('=') followed by some value</td></tr>
<tr><td>Is Identity</td><td>false</td><td>Indicated by the '!' symbol appended to the Name</td></tr>
</table>

The syntax is:

```
<Visibility> <Type><?><[MinLength-MaxLength]> <Name><!> <= Value>
```

or

```
<Visibility> <Name><!> : <Type><?><[MinLength-MaxLength]> <= Value>
```

**Examples:**

The following all declare a required string property with no length restrictions named foo:

```
foo
```

```
string foo
```

```
public string foo
```

```
foo: string
```

```
public foo: string
```

To make it an optional value:

```
string? foo
```

```
public string? foo
```

```
foo: string?
```

```
public foo: string?
```

Let's make it optional and restrict it to 50 characters:

```
string?[50] foo
```

```
public string?[50] foo
```

```
foo: string?[50]
```

```
public foo: string?[50]
```

Or ensure that it's between 10 and 50 characters


```
string?[10-50] foo
```

```
public string?[10-50] foo
```

```
foo: string?[10-50]
```

```
public foo: string?[10-50]
```

*(A bit more on this: MinLength isn't needed if you don't care about it, so [50] is perfectly
valid as a MaxLength specification. You would use [10-0] to say the MinLength is 10 but there
is no MaxLength, since having just one number in the brackets is interpreted as a MaxLength.
[0-50] is pefectly valid, but unnecessary, since [50] would do. [50-10] is right out - you'll get
an error trying to do that.*

*You might be wondering: if I specify a minimum length, does that mean it's required? 
The model won't automatically set the Required attribute if it sees a Min Length, since that
would mean that it's needed at object construction time, and you may not intend that to be true.)*


If we wanted to set it up in the entity's constructor with an initial value:

```
foo = "some value"
```

```
string foo = "some value"
```

```
public string foo = "some value"
```

```
foo: string = "some value"
```

```
public foo: string = "some value"
```

*(note that, while making a property optional and giving it a initial value is possible, it has limited
use cases)*

To add an identity property:

```
int foo!
```

```
public int foo!
```

```
foo!: int
```

```
public foo!: int
```

Let's make foo a `Nullable<Int64>` and have its setter inaccessible by outside code:

```
protected long? foo
```

```
protected foo: long?
```

To edit the properties as text, select the entity and right-click to get its context menu.
Choose _Add properties via Code_ and you'll see a small window pop up with the current
properties:

<table><tr><td>
<img src="images/PropertyEditor.jpg">
</td></tr></table>

Add, edit or remove text as required - when you click *OK*, all the properties will be replaced
by the parsed values of the text in that window. Any unrecognized values will be discarded.

You'll note that one of the options is for the text to be a list of valid C# property declarations, so if you
have classes that you want to add to the model, you'll be able to copy their property declarations and
paste them in here. Any lines with curly braces in them will be truncated at the first open brace. Trailing semicolons
are discarded as well.

Let's say you had an Address class in your code and wanted to add it to your persistent entity model.

```C#

   public class Address
   {
      public int Id               { get; set; }
      public string AddressLine1  { get; set; }
      public string AddressLine2  { get; set; }
      public string City          { get; set; }
      public string StateProvince { get; set; }
      public string PostalCode    { get; set; }
   }

```

You could add the class to the designer and open the *Add properties via Code* window. Copy and paste the properties from your class into this window and click OK.

<table><tr><td>
<img src="images/AddAddress-1.jpg">
</td></tr></table>

When you click OK, the Address class is updated with the new properties. 

<table><tr><td>
<img src="images/AddAddress-2.jpg">
</td></tr></table>

A few things to notice:

- We duplicated the `Id` property, since it was already in the entity and we didn't delete it before pasting. When the text was parsed and the properties created, that duplicate was discarded. A warning appeared in Visual Studio's error list letting us know that it was discarded and why.
- The `{ get; set; }` blocks were discarded, as was the semicolon (`;`) from the one property initially presented.
- We added properties using CLR types (`int` and `string`), but they were added to the model as object types (`Int32` and `String`).
- The properties were added as required properties! C# syntax doesn't (unless you're using C# 8.0) have a way to indicate that an object is nullable or not. 
  Since we didn't edit the code we pasted in, no `?` indicators were present to tell the parser that this isn't a required property. Note that, even
  if we had C# 8.0 available, the designer's property syntax purposely doesn't fit with C# non-nullable object syntax. That's to make you review
  what you've entered and think about doing the right thing for your model!
